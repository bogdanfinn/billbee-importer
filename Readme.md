# Billbee Importer

## Currently supported sources:
* Stockx sales csv
* Alias sales csv (scraped by RestocksAIO)

This application parses your stockx sales csv report or your scraped alias sales export via RestocksAIO and creates order emails out of it. 
Those emails will be sent to Billbee to create orders.
